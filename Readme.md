# TypeScript Interactive CLI Learning Project

Welcome to the TypeScript **Interactive CLI** Learning Project! This initiative is designed to offer an engaging and practical approach to learning TypeScript through a command-line interface. By working on this project, I deepened my understanding of TypeScript and aimed to create an interactive experience for others to explore TypeScript concepts via hands-on examples and exercises. This project was born out of a desire for a more dynamic and engaging way to learn coding.

ðŸš§ **This project is still in its early stage of development!** ðŸš§

## Key Features:

- **Interactive CLI**: Seamlessly navigate through various chapters with a **user-friendly** command-line interface.
- **Practical Examples**: Each chapter provides actionable code examples to illustrate specific TypeScript concepts.
- **Colorful Output**: Enhance your learning experience with color-coded console messages for improved readability.

## How It Works:

- **Interactive Menu**: Upon running the application, you will see a menu allowing you to choose which chapter to explore.
- **Dynamic Imports**: Chapters are dynamically loaded based on your selection, optimizing resource usage.
- **Error Handling**: The application includes robust error handling to ensure a smooth experience, even if invalid options are chosen.

## Technical Overview

This project includes a series of interactive CLI-based chapters designed to teach TypeScript through practical examples. Each chapter is a standalone TypeScript file that demonstrates specific concepts or features.
The project leverages **[inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)** for user input and **[colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors)** for colorful console output to enhance the learning experience.
In the following example you can see that you have to put your code inside the exported run function .

```typescript
export const run = () => {
  console.log('Chapter 2 - Type Annotations & Basic Types');
  //anything here will run once you select the correct chapter (as long the chapter is registred to tableofcontent.json)
};
```

## How to Clone and Run the Project
